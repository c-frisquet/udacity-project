##Udacity Front-end Project: Neighborhoud Map

This project required the use of [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/), [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), and another API of our choice, I choosed the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to procure each element an extract related to it from wikipedia.

This app use Webpack, npm, ES6 (with babel), and SASS. (and also ESLint)
To see the website you can clone the repository, run `npm start` in your terminal (`cd pathToTheRepository/NeighborhoodMap` before) and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice (you need to allow javascript for this app to work) or simply go to https://c-frisquet.github.io/NeighborhoodMap/. You can also `npm run build` and open `index.html` in `dist`.

To help me complete this project I used [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Knockout.js documentation](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html),  [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [mediawiki API documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), [webpack documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/).
